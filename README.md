# 👋 Florian D.

Lead e‑commerce developer focused on **automation**, **AI agents**, bots and long‑term product work.

## 🧠 What I’m working on

Most of my time goes into my own projects:  
automation pipelines, AI/agents, Discord bots, and tools that make real businesses run smoother.

If what you’re building overlaps with that universe (serious automation, agent‑powered workflows, custom bots, complex e‑commerce logic), just DM me and we’ll see if we share the same viewpoints.

## 🤖 For dev / tech projects

I’m interested in:

- Deep automations (catalogs, stock, logistics, pricing, reporting).
- AI agents and internal tools that support real teams, not just demos.
- Discord bots and integrations tied to actual business workflows.
- Infrastructure and backend work that has a clear business purpose.

If your project is experimental but ambitious and you know where you want to go, that’s usually a good sign.

## 🎨 For non‑devs (SMBs, individuals)

If you’re not a developer but:

- You need help defining a strong **visual identity** (logo, colors, basic design system).
- You’re thinking long term and want the **visual layer first**, then a proper **web / e‑commerce / infra** setup on top of it.
- You prefer something solid and scalable over “quick & cheap”.

You can contact me for long‑term projects only: first we align on the visual direction, then we build the web and commerce side on top of it.

## 📩 How to reach out

Keep it simple:  
tell me **who you are**, **what you do**, and **why automation / AI / design matters** for your project.  
If it makes sense and matches what I’m building, I’ll answer.
